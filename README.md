# joatblog

A personal blog about reclaiming time from bosses and bullshit, learning media by trial and error, and speaking freely. This is where I test, tinker, and occasionally overshare.

## What This Is

- A static HTML/CSS blog, with some limited JavaScript sprinkled in as necessary
- Posts are written by hand and manually added to the `index.html` or monthly archives
- Design is responsive and minimal
- Sometimes I break things on purpose to figure out how the web works

## How I Built It

- Pure HTML5 and vanilla CSS3, no frameworks
- Responsive design using grid, flexbox, and media queries
- Color themes via media queries and CSS custom properties
- Layouts managed with semantic elements instead of just divs
- Git for version control and GitHub Pages for free hosting

## What's Next

- Cleaning up
- Possibly adding post templates or lightweight JavaScript interactivity
- Managing entries more easily (thinking ahead about Markdown-to-HTML?)
- Possibly building a back-end
- It's all really just practice
