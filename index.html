          <p class="post">Going through the books this morning. Forgot how close JavaScript was to C. Once I get the semantics down, should be a breeze. I also did a little bit of rearanging my code this morning, including adding July archives, so I don't procrastinate and do it at the last minute. If I'm being completely honest, this is already a pain in the ass. So, I am setting a new goal, for this site to be dynamic by the end of September. Which means, I'll probably either have to have my own server or rent one. I don't think GitHub offers that service, but I could be wrong. I'll look into it.</p>

          <p> The only reason I am running this site this way, is because it was quick and dirty, to get shit up and running. Plus, it gives me the added benifit of practicing adding features, while something is live. It has made me a little paranoid in the amount that I test things before I commit. It used to be: "Well, it worked this time, fuck it, commit!" Now, I feel like I need to test every single item multiple times. I don't want the site to break, and hopefully thats a good thing. But, it might suck as I add complexity. Oh well, I'm still a noob, I'll figure shit out.</p>

          <p>In the mean time I kind of want to set some more goals. I have monetary goals, which I won't disclose, as they're only about eanrning enough from my job to move forward with this. I currently have no monetary goals for this in particular. I want it to grow, more or less, organically. And, to be honest, I don't know where or even if I want to make any money for this site. The code itself is absolutely free at my GitHub, which you can visit via the <a href="pages/about.html">About</a> page.</p>

          <p>Thinking about it, September might be a little lofty, as I have very little experience with back end developement. I basically have just enough to understand what's going on. I'll set that goal for the end of October. For a tiny little site like this, I would like to have my own server to run it. Which means, I need to finish building my business machine so I can convert this one into a linux server. That being said, I'm not sure it can handle all the one person who currently reads this blog, lol. So, some upgrades will be necessary. This is part of the other monetary goals.</p>

          <p>I would like to get that business site up and running. I either need permission for assets, or to build it generically. I would prefer the assets, because It's just a pain to come up with crap that's both generic and meaningful enough to attract people. That code is also currently available on my GitHub. If you're not a programmer and not sure how to see it live on your desktop, then go <a href="https://github.com/codejoat/raxexteriors" target="_blank">here</a>, click that motherfuckin' green drop-down button, you see "Download ZIP" hit that shit!, then unzip it's bitch-ass to desktop, open the god-damn folder, right-click the hell out of index.html, find where that shit says: "Open with", and click on any fucking browser you want. Alright, I hope my instructions are clear. For Apple or Linux, just copy-pasta this shit into ChatGPT and ask it to translate into either Linux or the "We still own your computer after you bought and paid for it company." That's all I've got, later.</p>
