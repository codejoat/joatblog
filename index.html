          <p class="post">One thing I just realized, is that this two-name thing is going to have to go or be better. I called this one: "Moving Forward", but I don't know if I used that already. There has to be a title, because it is easier to reference those than dates or numbers, so I'll just have to come up with something a little bit easier to deal with. I was thinking giving each a number for an id and then not worrying if I copy a title or not. Probably will work better for future-proofing this as well.</p>

          <p>So, moving forward, I am going to be just a bit cleaner with my language. If you read any of the posts, I have cleaned them up as much as I am going to for now. I think they're okay. I did leave some explicit language, but mostly on days where you could tell I was a bit irritated. I took out some of the more gratuitous stuff.</p>

          <p>Also, I went through and cleaned up a couple of archive posts where pictures and things weren't showing up. On that, I went into my cloud and found a bunch of pictures of some of my toys I gave up (sold) to go on this little programming venture. I will be sharing some of them, since I designed this site to have pictures along side the post, but I really don't have any pictures. I'll just share old ones. Almost everything I had was either sold on eBay or pawned to help keep me going while I got my bills down to a low enough level that I could afford to do a minimum amount of work and spend a lot of time doing this stuff. That was the plan... That is still the plan.</p>

          <p>I will eventually, and hopefully by next year, make money at this.  And, God willing, I will have my toys back. For now, I will share those pictures with anyone who reads these.</p>
