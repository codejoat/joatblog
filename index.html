          <p class="post">I am tired today. I woke up nice and early, but I didn't want to. The only thing I've done is mess around with the menu tab a little bit. I added a line, which I don't expect to stick around. It didn't work, then after deleting and undoing the delete, just to see if there was a difference, it worked. Magic is all I can assume at this point. Fuck. I don't have the mental capacity to look into it any further. At least, this morning. If it works on commit, fuck it for now. Coffee isn't doing it's fucking job.</p>

          <p> Been working until almost midnight and trying to wake up at 6am, so I have time to do this stuff. I woke up this morning, but just couldn't get going. I have to get some reading done this morning, so this is about all I will do with my site. I think for now, I will probably go and work on that business site. Then I have a few other one-page style sites I thought might be cool to build. By then, I would like to have some sort of a main hub going. Just a link to everything, including a couple of YouTube channels  I was thinking about.</p>

          <p>I might be spreading myself too thin. I don't know. If anything seems to be good, I will focus on that. For now, I just want to build some things and not worry about where it's all going. I should probably put in a picture. Otherwise this site looks too plain. Here's some magic, I'll post a picture of this exact post, lol.</p>
