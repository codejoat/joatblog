          <p class="post">DNS propagation was taking way too long, and I kept getting errors. Why did the first time I've done this go so smooth and the second there needs to be a change, everything just gets fucked. I kept seeing errors on GitHub pages, but for the life of me I couldn't find a single one. So, I tore it all down. Removed the repository, removed the git files and just fucking started again. I'm about to go and redo GitHub pages, So I wanted something to push first. I figured I would create a post. 
          
          <p>I took yesterday off work, so I could figure this shit out, here's hoping I get it today. I'm going to get some more coffee, but I really don't have much to say. It's at a point where I know it's not a big deal, but it feels like the whole thing is fucked. I can't let this shit happen when I launch the main hub. Shit like this would kill a company. So, it really does need to be out of my system by then. Luckily it's still brand new. Nobody knows about me, and therefore nobody knows about this. Enough rambling, onward to coffee...</p>
