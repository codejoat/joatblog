          <h4 class="timestamp">June 24, 2025 11:56 AM | DNS Propagation</h4>
          <p class="post">DNS propagation was taking way too long, and I kept getting errors. Why did the first time I've done this go so smooth and the second there needs to be a change, everything just gets fucked. I kept seeing errors on GitHub pages, but for the life of me I couldn't find a single one. So, I tore it all down. Removed the repository, removed the git files and just fucking started again. I'm about to go and redo GitHub pages, So I wanted something to push first. I figured I would create a post. 
          
          <p>I took yesterday off work, so I could figure this shit out, here's hoping I get it today. I'm going to get some more coffee, but I really don't have much to say. It's at a point where I know it's not a big deal, but it feels like the whole thing is fucked. I can't let this shit happen when I launch the main hub. Shit like this would kill a company. So, it really does need to be out of my system by then. Luckily it's still brand new. Nobody knows about me, and therefore nobody knows about this. Enough rambling, onward to coffee...</p>

          <p class="post">The servers have propagated, now just waiting for GitHub to catch up. Honestly, I feel good, this was much faster than yesterday. In fact, it was all red Xs until this morning. Tearing everything down and resetting was a good idea, this time. Don't get me wrong, most of the time it's a bad idea and causes way more work than is worth it. I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something asn was probably never going to find it. Sort of like missing seeing the keys on the table 15 times, then when you sit down and give up, there they fucking are. The brain hides things that are stressfull, even if finding those things will relieve the stress. The brain doen't know that. So it keeps the stress limited. I was going to go for a walk, but I think I might hit check again a few times first.</p>
