          <p class="post">I've taken a few days off from both this and regular work. I needed some time to ramp up studying and It seems to be going okay now, so I should get back to normal. I may not post every day, but that is probably going to be normal from now on. I may or may not have stated this earlier, but this is more for me than anyone who reads it.</p>
          <p>I'm getting ready to make a major overhaul to this site. And, with any luck, no one who reads it will be able to tell the difference. Basically, I want to move one step closer to setting this up to self-host. My plan is to take every post and to put them into a JavaScript file, where they can be loaded directly onto whatever page they happen to currently belong. This won't improve performance, though it might make it worse in the short term. For now, I am planning on having this done in about a week, if time allows.</p>
          <p>Another change that is going to take place, I am going to go through and clean up the language. I get a little bad sometimes, and I think if I want to take part in this world, and I do, then I will have to take more care to play by certain rules. With that, it'll probably be or sound just a little less authentic. And in some cases, maybe a little more. Also, I am going to try and add more pictures. That's all I have today.</p>

<!-- entry template: Use this to add new posts to the current page. Just copy-pasta this shit. Rework timestamp to current time, add image to src="", type a motherfuckin caption for that shit, and maybe an alt, and put your thoughts between the <p>s. If no image, you can delete figure or not, with nothing in it, it shouldn't affect anything.
