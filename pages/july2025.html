          <p class="post">Crap. Been really busy and wasn't able to post yesterday. I figured I should say something today, even if it's nothing. It is the first day of the second month, which this blog has been live. Seriously, that's all I've got. I'm tired.</p>

          <p class="post">I have been going back and forth on how personal I should let this whole thing get. I just don't know. It is supposed to be about me trying to build something, but that really isn't panning out to be a whole lot of content. And, what little content I make, seems a bit tedious at best. I mean, writing paragraphs about every little step I take, just isn't doing it for me. I still want to keep on keeping on with that, but just a little less. Just enough to note that I am still moving forward with stuff. </p>

          <p>I have to ask myself then, what's the point of even less content. Right now, it's not all that much and since I am hitting the books, I have less time than usual. Also, I haven't been putting pictures up. I'm just not sure what to do about this. It's so small that I don't care much, but It does still help me get my thoughts down, albeit very little and only on this subject. I can only say that I'll think about it for now.</p>

          <p>On another topic, I have decided to move forward with the other website in a generic way. I brought up the subject of using the one website's assests and haven't heard back from the guy. It was a combination of that and coming up with what I thought was a pretty good and funny idea for a generic website, promoting a business. Not going to talk any more about it until I can check domain names. I hope I can get the .com I want. I really can't imagine anyone having taken it. I should get off my lazy butt and check.</p>

          <p>Alright, it was available and I got it. I think I'll spend a bit of time tonight or tomorrow morning, taking the site down from my GitHub and reconfiguring for the new name. I hope I can make this work. In my head it's hilarious, but you know, a lot of things are.</p>

          <h4 class="timestamp">July 5, 2025 1:25 PM | Good Idea</h4>
          <p class="post">Have you ever had a good idea? Maybe it was one that you thought you could really work with and maybe should take precedence above all other projects? I had one of those yesterday. Today, I feel like it's stupid, but decided to move forward on it anyway. This whole morning I took steps to build a list of goals to complete it by January 1st of next year. It is going to be a lot of work, and it may all be for not. I'm not going to talk much about it. I will continue with these projects only if I am stuck or have free time, as a way to take my mind off of it. But, for now, my concentration has to go there. That's all I have for now.</p>

          <p class="post">I told you I wasn't good at this. I just sort of lose momentum sometimes. That's okay, I'll keep updating sometimes. Again this is more for me than anyone else, right now. Meh...</p>
